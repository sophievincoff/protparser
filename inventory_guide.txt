DATA SOURCE NOTE (how these columns were obtained)

This file mixes two kinds of information:

1) mmCIF-derived (from the structure file itself)
- Most columns are computed directly from the downloaded mmCIF file for the PDB entry.
- These reflect what is encoded in the deposited structure record (chains, entities, sequences, residue names, modification annotations, etc.).
- These fields can be reproduced from the mmCIF file alone.

2) RCSB website–derived (“RCSB-enriched” fields)
- Some columns are not taken from the mmCIF file.
- Instead, they are added by querying the RCSB PDB website’s published data endpoints for that entry/entity.
- This corresponds to information visible on RCSB web pages, accessed in a structured format.
- These fields often include:
  - UniProt ID mappings / alignments
  - Pfam/domain annotations
  - Disorder / disordered binding site annotations
  - Sequence conflict / insertion / deletion / mutation counts (from sequence-to-UniProt alignment summaries)
- These fields require internet access at runtime.
- They depend on the current RCSB annotations at the time of query and may change if RCSB updates cross-references or annotations.

How to interpret this:
- If a column is marked "mmCIF-derived", it comes directly from the deposited structure file.
- If a column is marked "RCSB website–derived", it reflects additional annotation or cross-references provided by RCSB.
